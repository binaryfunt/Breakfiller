# [Breakfiller](https://binaryfunt.github.io/breakfiller/index.html)

News "breakfiller" screen initally created for [IC HACK17](https://ichack17.devpost.com/) but worked on since then. Essentially it shows a slideshow of news (weather coming at some point), inspired by how BBC World News used to do this.

A [demo](https://binaryfunt.github.io/breakfiller/index.html) was previouly available, however the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) API no longer allows CORS requests from GH Pages, so the demo now just shows a neat news-screen-style background animation only.
