# [Breakfiller](https://binaryfunt.github.io/breakfiller/index.html)

News "breakfiller" screen initally created for [IC HACK17](https://ichack17.devpost.com/) but worked on since then. Essentially it shows a slideshow of news (weather coming at some point), inspired by how BBC World News used to do this.
